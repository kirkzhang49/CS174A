/**
 * @fileoverview This file contains functions every webgl program will need
 * a version of one way or another.
 *
 * Instead of setting up a context manually it is recommended to
 * use. This will check for success or failure. On failure it
 * will attempt to present an approriate message to the user.
 *
 *       gl = WebGLUtils.setupWebGL(canvas);
 *
 * For animated WebGL apps use of setTimeout or setInterval are
 * discouraged. It is recommended you structure your rendering
 * loop like this.
 *
 *       function render() {
 *         window.requestAnimFrame(render, canvas);
 *
 *         // do rendering
 *         ...
 *       }
 *       render();
 *
 * This will call your rendering function up to the refresh rate
 * of your display but will stop rendering if your app is not
 * visible.
